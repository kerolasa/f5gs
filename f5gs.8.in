.SH NAME
f5gs \- F5 graceful scaling helper daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B f5gs
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This daemon is intended to be used as an additional loadbalancer health
check.  The loadbalancer has to have a away to add a health check in
alternative port in order to use this too.  For example recent versions
of F5 provide such functionality.  Health check answer from this command
will be standalone in comparison to service that the health check is
related to.  Idea is simply to provide easy to control daemon when
indicating the service state with content of the backend service is
difficult.
.PP
This daemon will listen a TCP port
.BR @PORT_NUM@ .
All connections to that port will be replied with one of the following
responses:
.IR disable ,
.IR maintenance ,
.IR enable ,
or
.IR unknown .
Run state is wrote to a file, where it is retrieved at daemon start up.
First number in run state file is pid of the daemon, second is a internal
state code, and third the file format version.  Run states are wrote to a
directory that can contain multiple files.  The files are identified by
listen address and tcp port.  This allows having several
.B f5gs
instances running in same server.
.PP
The
.I unknown
cannot be set.  It stands for health check state that is never set.  From
F5 point of view
.I unknown
and
.I disable
states are the same.
.PP
The daemon will client for one second to submit something, and ignore
first 256 bytes of the submission.  Any excess input does not get read,
and will result to a socket error at the other end of the connection.
The best idea is to use internal identifier, such as F5 host name, as
health check submission, so that debugging with tcpdump is easy.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-disable\fR
Disable the health check.  This will stop new connections to arrive, and
shut old connections immediately.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maintenance\fR
Use health check to quiesce connections.  This will stop new connections
to arrive, while the existing connections are served.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-enable\fR
Enable health check.  This will set the service to normal operational state.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-server\fR
Start the health check daemon.  The daemon tries to find old service
state file, and set the initial state to what is used to be.  If any of
the state change options is used with \-\-service option the option will
override contents of the old state file.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-listen\fR \fIaddress\fR
Bind the server to
.IR address .
When the
.I address
is defined without \-\-server option status will be requested from that
.IR address .
Address can be IP or a DNS name.  The default address is 0.\:0.\:0.\:0,
that binds the server to all interface.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR \fIport\fR
TCP
.I port
of the server.  Default port is
.IR @PORT_NUM@ .
.TP
\fB\-\-state\fR \fIdirectory\fR
Relocate the command
.I state directory
to elsewhere from
.IR @f5gs_rundir@ .
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Do not print anything, but inform with an exit value below what is the
state.  This option is applicable only when running in client mode, and
is meant to be used in scripts.
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B 0
enable
.TP
.B 1
maintenance
.TP
.B 2
disable
.TP
.B 3
unknown, or an error while determining the state such as f5gs server not running
.PD
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-scripts\fR
Skip running pre or post scripts at state change.
.TP
\fB\-\-foreground\fR
Run server process in foreground with result an operator can see error
messages from terminal rather than syslog or journal.  This option is
useful only when debugging.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information, and what compile modules are in use, and
exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help and exit.
.SH EXAMPLE
f5gs --server
.br
f5gs --enable
.br
echo hello | nc localhost @PORT_NUM@ ; echo
.SH BUGS
Please report to author if you find a bug.
.PP
Lack of daemon stop functionality is known quirk, and done on purpose.
If a host needs this service you will never want to stop the service,
disabling is as good as stopping.  If you really want stop you should
kill the process.
.SH SYSTEMD INTEGRATION
When compiled with systemd support the
.B f5gs
will use socket actication.  The message that usually are sent to
syslog are using journald native integration.  Message ID fields that
are in use are
.TS

.SH LICENSE
The f5gs has BSD 2-clause license which also known as "Simplified BSD
License" or "FreeBSD License".
.SH FILES
.TP
.B @f5gs_pre@
An executable that is ran before state change is sent.  If a return value
of the executable is not success
.RB ( 0 )
the state change is cancelled.  The executable will receive same command
line options and arguments as the original
.BR f5gs .
See
.I @datadir@/f5gs/pre-script
for an example how to write a srcipt like this.
.TP
.B @f5gs_post@
An executable that is ran after state change is sent.  Return value of
the executable is ignored.  For the rest see pre script above.
.BR f5gs .
.TP
.B @f5gs_rundir@
Location of the state files.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B f5gs
will hardcode PATH to have value
.I /bin:\:/usr/bin:\:/sbin:\:/usr/sbin
and other environment variables are removed before running
.I pre
or
.I post
executables.
