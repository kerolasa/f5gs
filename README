F5 Graceful Scaling.

	This is a simple tcp daemon, which is intented to be used as a
	messanger from a server to a F5 load balancing switch.  One is
	expected to make a F5 switch to poll with a health check the
	f5gs daemon, that will tell the state of the service.  The
	reason why one might want to use helper deamon instead of the
	'apache + a file in an URL' is that not all services are HTTP.
	One can use F5 to load balance DNS request, or SMTP, and such
	services need a mechanism to tell their state.

	The daemon can be useful for HTTP servers, as a secondary
	health check.  That will allow one to stop and start a HTTP
	server, and control flow of traffic separately.  While such
	case is unlikely needed when having an Apaches as load
	balancing backend, but in a case of Varnish or Java HTTP it is
	nice to have a control mechanism that is not fiddling with the
	server itself.

	See also NEWS file for a blog like information about the
	command, and rationality why something was implemented
	including what was the intented use of it.
