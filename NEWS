	Release v0.2 that makes the utility to behave like a reasonable
	daemon.  It also includes manual page, autotools setup with
	gnulib to make the thing portable.

	There is also support for pre and post state change scripts,
	that one can use to do additional tasks at a time of an event.
	The reason why a script support was added is local installation
	I am working with.  When a java service is put to maintenance
	or disable state, e.g., F5 is told not to send trafic,
	broadcast messaging from that java service has to be halted as
	well.  The easiest way to do that is to add a iptables deny
	rule for broadcasts, but I cannot possibly add such to the
	f5gs, so the support for 'random' actions has to be external.

	My intention is to control contents of pre annd post scripts
	with puppet.  The nice thing about this decision is that the
	puppet is environment aware, so I can fairly precisely tell
	what sort of additional actions are needed on a server I plan
	to control.

	The beginning.
