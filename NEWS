	Release v0.4.  When ever a developer tells program is ready to
	be used is is reasonable to doubt statement being somehow
	wrong by mistake, or due overconfidence.  The latest version
	changes persistent state file path, and format.

	Format got go be changed because use of state numbers changed,
	and it became obvious the state file has to be versioned in
	order to recover from similar mess in future.  This time the
	version checking is not done quite by the book, because version
	file did not persist over reboot.  Earlier use of /var/run was
	a mistake, now the state is wrote to /var/spool instead.

	If you upgrade be sure to set preferred state after an upgrade
	action.  Lets hope there are no more breaking changes in
	future, that require user interaction.

	Release v0.3.  This release adds support to systemd and makes
	messaging to use journald when they are available.  Various
	threading and signaling issues are fixed.  The contrib directory
	has an example to puppet management of the f5gs, and a script
	demonstrating how to perform pre-state change actions.  Some of
	the changes make the command performance to be better, while
	other ensure the daemon is very difficult to knock out with
	(d)dos.  The making of abuse hard meant fixing all resource
	leaks.

	IMHO the software has production quality.

	Release v0.2 that makes the utility to behave like a reasonable
	daemon.  It also includes manual page, autotools setup with
	gnulib to make the thing portable.

	There is also support for pre and post state change scripts,
	that one can use to do additional tasks at a time of an event.
	The reason why a script support was added is local installation
	I am working with.  When a java service is put to maintenance
	or disable state, e.g., F5 is told not to send trafic,
	broadcast messaging from that java service has to be halted as
	well.  The easiest way to do that is to add a iptables deny
	rule for broadcasts, but I cannot possibly add such to the
	f5gs, so the support for 'random' actions has to be external.

	My intention is to control contents of pre annd post scripts
	with puppet.  The nice thing about this decision is that the
	puppet is environment aware, so I can fairly precisely tell
	what sort of additional actions are needed on a server I plan
	to control.

	The beginning.
